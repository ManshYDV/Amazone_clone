# ðŸ›’ Amazon Clone (In Progress)

This is a **basic Amazon clone project** built using **Java Spring Boot**, focusing on the backend structure and authentication flow.  
The goal is to learn and implement core features of a typical e-commerce application while exploring Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, MySQL, and more.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot
- **Authentication:** Spring Security, JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Database:** MySQL (for product and user data)
- **Frontend:** Basic HTML/CSS + JavaScript (for now)
- **ORM:** Hibernate / Spring Data JPA
